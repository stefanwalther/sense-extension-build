## Welcome !

This is the right page for you if you want to make changes to any of the Qlik Sense Visualization extensions I have created.
They all follow the same pattern:

## Building the Project

To make changes to the project, it is recommended to take these steps:

* Fork the project
* run `npm install`
* All source files for the extension are located in the `./src` directory

Whenever you make changes to the `./src` files, just rebuild the entire project:

- Install sense-go as global package: `npm install -g sense-go`
- Run `sense-go build`

This will actually

- Create a new build in the `./build/dev` directory.
- Create a new zipped version of your build called `%project_name%_dev.zip` in the `./build/` directory.

Release your changes:

- Run `sense-go release`

Which will

- Create a new build in the `./build/release` directory
- Create a new zipped version of your build called `%project_name%_v%%pkg.version%%` (as defined in `package.json`)
    - e.g. `sense-navigation_v1.0`
